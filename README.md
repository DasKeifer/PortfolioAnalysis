# Portfolio Analysis
A set of tools to analyze portfolios with various daily rebalancing rules.
I created this because other online reasource I found only would do monthly rebalancing. Specifics of my own analysis were scrubbed for liability reasons.
This contains functions for pulling data, simulating leverages, estimating historic bond prices, and evaluating portfolios using percentage based rebalances with various parameters related to when and how to rebalance

Legal Disclaimers: All the typical investment disclaimers - I am not a financial advisor and am no way am trying to provide financial advice. Use these tools at your own risk. I cannot guarantee historic accuracy. Past results of the stock market do not guarantee future results.

Note that this is still early code so it is likely to change and as such has largely not been documented yet
